<h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>We live in a world where communities hold prejudices against one another, shaped by the labels of class, caste, religion, gender, and ethnicity. These prejudices often lead to a lack of understanding, and ultimately, disunity. Is there a way to bridge these divides? What if we were able to create a safe space of understanding at a young age - would that change the way each citizen views the world?</p>

  <p>Clicking Together uses photography to help young citizens transcend boundaries of difference and prejudice.</p>

  <p>We accomplish this through photography camps for youths. We aim for our students to see their lives, their cities, and the different communities within their cities from broader perspectives.</p>
